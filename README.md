# My-Personal-Blog
A personal blog for anyone to add notes about themselves for work or personal reasons. The reason behind construsting this webpage is to expand my knowedge on button functionality, the use and definitions of local storage, and to link multiple files together into 1 project. 

Upon entering this webpage, the user is gratned with a light/dark mode button and a few form boxes, if the form is incorrectly filled, then the browser will prompt them to complete the form before it redirects to their blog page. Once on the blog page, the user can see their infrmation on the page, on the console, and on local storage. They then can toggle light/dark mode in the blog page and also press the back button to return to the form page. 

You can view the link to the webpage, here:
